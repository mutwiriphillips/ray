# Skywalkers Ltd

A Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind site for Skywalkers Ltd, the parent corporation of two
divisions, backed by an Express API and an admin dashboard for handling consultation requests.

- **DigitizeBiz** — digitizes and manages **business** assets (web/app design, social media,
  database management, company/business/sacco registration, payroll).
- **CitizenEase** — digitizes and manages **individual** assets: a consultancy that handles every
  eCitizen and county-government service a person needs (identity & civil registration, travel &
  mobility, property & housing, compliance & clearance, education & family, county-level permits,
  plus a diaspora concierge tier).
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`) — password-protected page where consultation requests submitted
  from either division's contact form can be reviewed, filtered, have their status updated, or be
  deleted. See `backend/README.md` for the full API and security notes.

## Project layout

This is two apps in one repo:

```
/                 the frontend (this README)
/backend          the Express API — see backend/README.md
```

They run as two separate processes, talking over HTTP.

## Getting started (both apps)

```bash
# 1. Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Temporary: hash-password script removed for this trial run — generate inline instead:
node --input-type=commonjs -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 12))" "choose-a-strong-password"
# paste the printed hash into .env as ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
# also set JWT_SECRET in .env — see backend/README.md
npm run dev            # starts on http://localhost:4000

# 2. Frontend (separate terminal, from the repo root)
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # VITE_API_URL defaults to http://localhost:4000, adjust if needed
npm run dev             # starts on http://localhost:5173
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` for the site, and `http://localhost:5173/admin` to sign in with the
password you hashed above.

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Design system

- **Palette**: ink navy (`#16233A`), warm paper (`#F4F1EA`), signal teal (`#1F7A6C`), terracotta
  clay (`#B4552F`) — teal is DigitizeBiz's accent, clay is CitizenEase's accent, so the two
  divisions stay visually distinct while sharing the same masterbrand shell.
- **Typography**: Fraunces (display) + Inter (body), loaded via Google Fonts in `index.html`.
- **Dark mode**: via `next-themes`, toggled from the nav.

## Cart & checkout

Every service on both division pages — the 11 DigitizeBiz cards and every individual item under
each CitizenEase category — has an **Add to cart** button. The cart (`src/lib/cart.tsx`) persists
in `localStorage`, so it survives navigation between pages and page reloads, and is shared across
both divisions.

At `/cart`, each item shows its own document checklist (the same required-documents data used by
CitizenEase's Document Checklist tool and now also attached to every DigitizeBiz service) with
checkboxes — purely for the client's own reference before checkout, not a gate on submitting.

Checkout asks for name, contact, and an optional message once, then submits — internally, one
`POST /api/consultations` per division present in the cart, each carrying its own `services[]`
list, so a cart spanning both divisions cleanly becomes up to two consultations, each in the right
division's admin queue, rather than one ambiguous mixed request. This is additive: the existing
free-form contact forms on each division page still work exactly as before, for general enquiries
that aren't about a specific listed service — `services` is simply empty on those.

The admin dashboard's **Services** column shows what was selected via cart checkout, and stays
empty (`—`) for plain contact-form submissions, so the two request types stay visually distinct
without needing separate tables.

## Deploying to Render

This repo includes a `render.yaml` Blueprint that provisions both services — the backend (Node
web service) and the frontend (static site) — on Render's **free tier**, and wires their public
URLs to each other automatically. You don't need to hand-copy any URLs between them, and you don't
need a payment method on the account.

**Prerequisite:** Render Blueprints deploy from a connected Git repository, not a zip upload. Push
this project to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo first.

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. In the Render Dashboard: **New → Blueprint**, and connect that repo. Render reads
   `render.yaml` from the repo root automatically.
3. Render will prompt you for `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` plus the notification variables (all marked
   `sync: false` in `render.yaml`). Generate the password hash locally first (the `hash-password`
   script is temporarily removed for this trial run, so this generates it inline instead):
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   node --input-type=commonjs -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 12))" "choose-a-strong-password"
   ```
   Paste the printed hash in when Render asks for it. (`JWT_SECRET` is generated for you
   automatically; `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` and `VITE_API_URL` are filled in from each service's actual
   deployed URL — that's what the `fromService` entries in `render.yaml` do.) The notification
   variables (`GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`, `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
   `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `ADMIN_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`) are optional — leave any of them blank in
   the prompt and that channel is simply skipped. See "Notifications" in `backend/README.md` for
   how to obtain each one.
4. Click **Deploy Blueprint**. Render builds and deploys both services, no billing/subscription
   required.
5. Once both are live, visit the frontend's `.onrender.com` URL, and `/admin` to sign in with the
   password you hashed in step 3.

### The trade-off on the free tier: consultations don't persist

Free Render web services have no persistent disk — the backend's JSON-file storage
(`backend/data/consultations.json`) resets every time the service redeploys or spins down from
inactivity (free services sleep after 15 minutes idle and cold-start on the next request; that
alone doesn't lose data, but a redeploy or manual restart does). For getting the site live and the
forms working, this is a fine starting point. It's not fine for actually relying on submitted
consultations long-term.

**When you're ready for real persistence**, upgrade the backend service to a paid instance type
(Starter or above) and add a disk — either in the Dashboard (Settings → Disks → Add Disk, mount
path `/opt/render/project/src/backend/data`, then update `startCommand`/`buildCommand` if
prompted), or in `render.yaml`:

```yaml
plan: starter
disk:
  name: skywalkers-data
  mountPath: /opt/render/project/src/backend/data
  sizeGB: 1
```

Add that back under the backend service, push, and Render will pick it up on the next sync. This
requires a payment method on the account, since only paid instance types support attached disks.

### Manual setup (without the Blueprint)

If you'd rather click through the dashboard instead of using `render.yaml`:

1. **New → Web Service** → connect the repo → set **Root Directory** to `backend`, build command
   `npm install && npm run build`, start command `npm start`, health check path `/api/health`,
   instance type **Free**. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` and `JWT_SECRET` under Environment (leave
   `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` for step 3). Skip disks for now — see "The trade-off on the free tier" above
   for adding one later once you're on a paid instance type.
2. **New → Static Site** → connect the repo → Root Directory `.` (repo root), build command
   `npm install && npm run build`, publish directory `dist`. Add a rewrite rule `/*` → `/index.html` so
   client-side routes like `/admin` work on refresh (the included `public/_redirects` covers this
   automatically on Render and Netlify alike).
3. Copy each service's `.onrender.com` URL into the other's environment variables:
   `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` on the backend, `VITE_API_URL` on the frontend (this triggers a frontend
   rebuild since Vite bakes it in at build time).

### Other hosts

Nothing here is Render-specific at the code level — the backend is a plain Node process
(`npm run build && npm start`) and the frontend is a static build (`npm run build` → `dist/`), so
both also run as-is on Railway, Fly.io, a VPS, etc. Just replicate the same three things anywhere:
point the frontend's `VITE_API_URL` at wherever the backend ends up, point the backend's
`FRONTEND_ORIGIN` at wherever the frontend ends up, and give the backend persistent storage for
`backend/data` (or swap in a real database).

## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel deploys this as **one project**: the frontend builds as a static site, and the backend
runs as a single serverless function (`api/[...path].ts`, a catch-all that hands every `/api/*`
request to the same Express app used by the standalone server). `vercel.json` at the repo root
configures the SPA fallback so `/admin` and the division pages work on direct load; `/api/*` is
left alone so it reaches the function.

**The one real difference from Render: storage.** Vercel functions are stateless — there's no
persistent local filesystem to write `consultations.json` to. The backend already accounts for
this: `backend/src/lib/store.ts` automatically uses **Upstash Redis** (Vercel's current
Marketplace-integrated key-value store — Vercel's own former "Vercel KV" product was sunset and
replaced by this) whenever its environment variables are present, and falls back to the JSON file
store otherwise. You don't need to change any code — just connect the integration:

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. In the Vercel dashboard: **Add New → Project**, import the repo. Vercel auto-detects the Vite
   framework; the included `vercel.json` handles the rest (build command, output directory, SPA
   rewrite). Leave the root directory as the repo root — the `/api` function needs to sit next to
   `vercel.json`.
3. **Storage → Marketplace Database Storage → Redis (Upstash)** → create a database and connect
   it to this project. Vercel injects `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` into
   the project automatically — that's what flips `store.ts` over to the Redis-backed
   implementation.
4. Under **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` — generate it the same way as for Render:
     `cd backend && npm install && node --input-type=commonjs -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync(process.argv[1], 12))" "your-password"`
   - `JWT_SECRET` — any long random string (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   - `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` — your Vercel deployment's own URL (e.g.
     `https://your-project.vercel.app`); CORS is same-origin here so this mostly matters if you
     also expose the API separately
   - `VITE_API_URL` — set to an **empty string**. Frontend and backend share one origin in this
     setup, so the app should call relative paths like `/api/consultations`, not an absolute URL.
   - `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`, `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
     `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `ADMIN_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` — optional; see "Notifications" in
     `backend/README.md` for what each does and how to obtain them. Leave any of them out and that
     notification channel is skipped automatically.
5. Deploy. Visit the project's URL, and `/admin` to sign in.

### Why this needs its own storage path (and how to verify it)

This part — the Upstash-backed store and the `api/[...path].ts` entry point — is new code that
hasn't been run against a live Vercel deployment or a real Upstash instance in this environment
(same no-network sandbox constraint as everything else in this repo). It was written directly
against Upstash's documented `@upstash/redis` SDK (`get`/`set`/`mget`/`zadd`/`zrange`/`zrem`,
all stable, long-standing methods), and passes the same static checks as the rest of the project
(see below) — but treat it as the part most worth a real test deploy before relying on it,
specifically:
- Connect the Upstash integration on a throwaway Vercel project first and submit a test
  consultation through the live site, then confirm it shows up in `/admin`.
- Restart/redeploy the function afterward and confirm the data is still there (that's the actual
  point of not using the file store on Vercel).

If anything about the Upstash SDK's method signatures has changed since this was written, the fix
is isolated to `backend/src/lib/kvStore.ts` — nothing else needs to change.

## Known constraints / how this was verified

This project was built in a sandboxed environment with **no network access**, so `npm install` and
a live build could not be run here for either app. Dependency versions were checked against
known-good, currently-published ranges (in particular `lucide-react` is pinned to `^0.487.0` — the
stable pre-1.0 range — and the file-storage path deliberately avoids any dependency with native
bindings; the Upstash-backed path used for Vercel is the one dependency that talks to an external
service and is the piece most worth a real test deploy — see "Deploying to Vercel" above).

In place of a live build, the following checks were run manually against every source file, across
the frontend, the backend, and the `api/` serverless entry point:

- Brace/paren/bracket balance across all `.ts`/`.tsx` files
- Every local import traced to a real file — including the cross-directory import from
  `api/[...path].ts` into `backend/src/app.ts` — and every named import checked against that
  file's actual exports
- All `package.json`/`tsconfig*.json` files, plus `render.yaml` and `vercel.json`, validated as
  well-formed JSON/YAML
- Backend relative imports checked for the `.js` extension required by `NodeNext` module
  resolution
- `robots.txt` (`Allow: /`) checked for consistency with the `index,follow` meta tag in
  `index.html`
- Tailwind color utility classes (`bg-ink-soft`, `text-teal`, `border-clay`, `bg-card-dark`, etc.)
  checked against the nested color tokens defined in `tailwind.config.ts`

Before deploying, run `npm install && npm run build` locally (or in CI) for both `/` and
`/backend` to catch anything a static read-through can't — type errors, resolution issues, etc.

**No lockfiles are committed** (`package-lock.json`), for the same reason — they're generated by
`npm install`, which couldn't run here. `render.yaml` and the manual setup steps above use
`npm install` rather than `npm ci` for this reason: `npm ci` requires a lockfile that matches
`package.json` exactly and fails immediately if one isn't present. Once you've run
`npm install` locally for both `/` and `/backend` and committed the resulting
`package-lock.json` files, you can switch either build command back to `npm ci` for faster,
more reproducible installs — just keep the lockfile in sync with `package.json` after that (delete
and regenerate it if `EUSAGE` reappears after editing dependencies by hand).

## Next steps

- Confirm final Skywalkers Ltd domain/branding assets (logo mark currently a placeholder "S").
- Add pricing to the DigitizeBiz and CitizenEase service cards once the revenue model (see the
  Skywalkers Ltd strategy document) is finalized.
- Optional backend extensions: email/SMS notification on new consultation, CSV export from the
  admin dashboard, multi-admin accounts if more than one person needs access.
